It is one of the most famous and basic machine learning classification problem. In the code, i tried to compare different classification algorithm to improve the accurace of model. The results are as follows:

1.Random Forest	-- 82.06 ,

2.Gradient Boosting Classifier --	82.06 ,

3.Support Vector Machines --	81.61 ,

4.KNN --	81.61 ,

5.Decision Tree --	79.82 ,

6.Logistic Regression --	78.48 ,

7.Naive Bayes --	78.03 ,

8.Stochastic Gradient Descent --	78.03 ,

9.Linear SVC --	77.13 ,

10.Perceptron --	76.23 ,
